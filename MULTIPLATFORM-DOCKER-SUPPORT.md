# Multiplatform Docker Support Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of multiplatform Docker support for the MCP Context Forge project, addressing [Issue #80](https://github.com/IBM/mcp-context-forge/issues/80) and [PR #322](https://github.com/IBM/mcp-context-forge/pull/322).

## Problem Statement

The original issue was that the project only built single-platform Docker images, and there were ARM64 build failures in the `Containerfile.lite` when attempting to build multiplatform images. The specific issues were:

1. **Shell compatibility**: The builder stage used `/bin/bash` but ARM64 UBI images might not have bash available by default
2. **Repository access issues**: ARM64 builds had issues accessing certain repositories
3. **GitHub Actions workflows**: The workflows only supported single-platform builds

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Containerfile.lite ARM64 Compatibility

**File**: `Containerfile.lite`

**Changes**:
- Changed `SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-euo", "pipefail", "-c"]` to `SHELL ["/bin/sh", "-euo", "pipefail", "-c"]`
- Added `bash` to the package installation list to ensure bash is available when needed
- Added `--setopt=skip_if_unavailable=1` to dnf commands for better ARM64 repository handling

**Rationale**: Using `/bin/sh` instead of `/bin/bash` provides better cross-platform compatibility while still ensuring bash is available for complex operations.

### 2. Updated GitHub Actions Workflows

#### docker-image.yml
**Changes**:
- Updated build command to use `--platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64`
- Changed from `--load` to `--push` (required for multiplatform builds)
- Updated step name to reflect multiplatform nature

#### docker-release.yml
**Changes**:
- Added Docker Buildx setup step
- Updated to use `docker buildx imagetools create` for multiplatform image tagging
- Removed separate push step (handled by buildx)

#### ibm-cloud-code-engine.yml
**Changes**:
- Updated build command to use `--platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64`
- Changed from `--load` to `--push`
- Removed separate push step

### 3. Enhanced Makefile Support

**File**: `Makefile`

**Changes**:
- Improved `container-build-multi` target with `--driver docker-container` for better compatibility
- Added new `container-build-multi-local` target for local testing without push
- Updated help documentation for new targets
- Added proper builder creation and management

**New Targets**:
- `container-build-multi`: Build and push multiplatform images
- `container-build-multi-local`: Build multiplatform images locally for testing

## Technical Details

### Build Platforms Supported
- `linux/amd64` (Intel/AMD 64-bit)
- `linux/arm64` (ARM 64-bit, including Apple Silicon)

### Docker Buildx Configuration
- Uses `docker-container` driver for better multiplatform support
- Automatic builder creation and management
- Proper cache handling for both local and CI environments

### GitHub Actions Integration
- All workflows now support multiplatform builds
- Proper authentication and registry handling
- Maintains existing security scanning and signing capabilities

## Testing

### Local Testing
1. **Single platform build**: `make container-build` - ✅ Verified working
2. **Multiplatform build**: `make container-build-multi-local` - ✅ Verified working
3. **Docker buildx availability**: ✅ Confirmed available

### CI/CD Testing
- Updated workflows maintain compatibility with existing security scanning
- Multiplatform images are properly tagged and pushed to registries
- Release workflow handles multiplatform image tagging correctly

## Benefits

1. **Cross-platform compatibility**: Images now work on both Intel/AMD and ARM-based systems
2. **Apple Silicon support**: Native support for Apple M1/M2/M3 Macs
3. **Cloud compatibility**: Better support for ARM-based cloud instances
4. **Backward compatibility**: Existing functionality remains unchanged
5. **Performance**: ARM64 images run more efficiently on ARM hardware

## Usage

### For Developers
```bash
# Build multiplatform image locally (for testing)
make container-build-multi-local

# Build and push multiplatform image (requires registry access)
make container-build-multi
```

### For CI/CD
The GitHub Actions workflows automatically build multiplatform images when:
- Code is pushed to main branch
- Pull requests are created
- Releases are published

## Files Modified

1. `Containerfile.lite` - ARM64 compatibility fixes
2. `.github/workflows/docker-image.yml` - Multiplatform build support
3. `.github/workflows/docker-release.yml` - Multiplatform release handling
4. `.github/workflows/ibm-cloud-code-engine.yml` - Multiplatform deployment
5. `Makefile` - Enhanced multiplatform build targets
6. `test-multiplatform.sh` - Testing script (created)

## Future Considerations

1. **Additional platforms**: Could extend to support other architectures if needed
2. **Build optimization**: Could implement build caching strategies for faster builds
3. **Testing automation**: Could add automated multiplatform testing in CI/CD

## Conclusion

The multiplatform Docker support has been successfully implemented, addressing all the issues mentioned in the original PR. The solution provides robust cross-platform support while maintaining backward compatibility and existing functionality.
