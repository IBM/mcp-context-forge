"""Generated protobuf Python classes for ContextForge plugins.

This package contains standard protobuf Python classes (_pb2.py files) generated
from protobuf schemas. These are used for cross-language serialization.

The canonical Python implementation uses Pydantic models in mcpgateway.plugins.framework.models
which have model_dump_pb() and model_validate_pb() methods for conversion.

Generated using standard protoc from schemas in protobufs/plugins/schemas/
