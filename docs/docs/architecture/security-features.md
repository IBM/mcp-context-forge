## Multi-Layered Defense Strategy

MCP Gateway implements a comprehensive, multi-layered security approach with "defense in depth" and "secure by design" principles:

### Security Philosophy

- **Proactive Security**: Security measures are built-in from design phase, not added retroactively
- **Human + Automated**: Combines 30+ automated security tools with manual code reviews and threat modeling
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular updates to security toolchain and practices based on community feedback
- **Shared Responsibility**: Security across all system components - gateway is one layer in your defense strategy

### Comprehensive Security Pipeline

**Pre-commit Security Gates**: 
- Bandit, Semgrep, Dodgy for security scanning
- Type checking and code quality enforcement
- Run `make security-all` locally before pushing

**Continuous Integration Security**: 
- 30+ security scans on every PR
- CodeQL semantic analysis
- Gitleaks secret detection
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Container security assessment

**Runtime Security**:
- Monitoring and security policies
- Anomaly detection
- Incident response procedures

## Production Deployment Security

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Production Requirements

**The Admin UI is development-only and must NEVER be exposed in production**:
- Designed for localhost-only access with trusted MCP servers
- Single-user administration without access controls
- Must be disabled in production: `MCPGATEWAY_UI_ENABLED=false`

### üìã Production Security Checklist

- [ ] **Disable unused features** (`FEATURES_ROOTS_ENABLED=false`, `FEATURES_PROMPTS_ENABLED=false`, etc.)
- [ ] **Disable Admin UI and API** (`MCPGATEWAY_UI_ENABLED=false`, `MCPGATEWAY_ADMIN_API_ENABLED=false`)
- [ ] **Enable authentication** with strong passwords/keys and custom usernames
- [ ] **Configure TLS/HTTPS** with valid certificates (never HTTP in production)
- [ ] **Validate all MCP servers** before connecting
- [ ] **Implement network controls** (firewalls, ingress policies)
- [ ] **Set rate limits** per endpoint and client
- [ ] **Configure monitoring** and anomaly detection
- [ ] **Secure databases** (TLS, strong passwords, restricted access)
- [ ] **Set resource limits** (CPU, memory) to prevent DoS
- [ ] **Implement secrets management** (never hardcode credentials)
- [ ] **Configure CORS policies** appropriately
- [ ] **Disable debug mode** in production
- [ ] **Keep gateway updated** to latest version
- [ ] **Regular security audits** of connected servers

## Security Best Practices

### Gateway as One Layer in Defense-in-Depth

MCP Gateway should be integrated as **one component** in a comprehensive security architecture:

1. **Upstream validation**: Validate and trust all MCP servers before connection
2. **Gateway validation**: Input/output validation at gateway level
3. **Downstream validation**: Applications must implement their own security controls
4. **Network isolation**: Use network policies to restrict access
5. **Comprehensive monitoring**: Log and alert on suspicious activities

### Integration Requirements

MCP Gateway is **not a standalone product**. Integrate with:
- API gateways/reverse proxies (auth, rate-limiting, routing)
- Secrets management systems (Vault, SOPS)
- Identity and access management (IAM) platforms
- Logging, monitoring, and SIEM platforms
- Runtime security and anomaly detection
- Custom UI/orchestration layers for multi-tenancy

### Developer Security Tools

**Core Security Commands**:
- `make security-all` - Run all security tools
- `make security-report` - Generate security report
- `make security-fix` - Auto-fix issues where possible
- `make pre-commit` - Run pre-commit hooks locally
- `make lint` - 30+ linting and security tools

**Individual Security Scanners**:
- `make bandit` - Python security vulnerabilities
- `make semgrep` - Semantic code analysis
- `make dodgy` - Hardcoded secrets detection
- `make gitleaks` - Git history secrets scan
- `make pip-audit` - Dependency vulnerabilities
- `make trivy` - Container security scan
- `make grype-scan` - Container vulnerability audit
- `make osv-scan` - Open source vulnerability scan

## Multi-Tenancy Considerations

**MCP Gateway is not yet multi-tenant ready**. For multi-user platforms, implement:
- User isolation and data segregation
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Resource cleanup and lifecycle management
- Tenant-specific validation and limits
- Per-user audit logging
- Team/organization management

Deploy as a **single-tenant component** within your larger multi-tenant architecture.

## Security Patching Policy

**‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer**: All patching is **best-effort** with no SLAs or commercial support.

- **Critical/High**: Best-effort patches within 1 week (minor version bump)
- **Medium**: Addressed in next release (~2 weeks)
- **Low**: Regular maintenance updates (~2-4 weeks)
- **No backports**: Fixes only applied to latest main branch
- **No zero-day guarantees**: Users must evaluate and mitigate risks
