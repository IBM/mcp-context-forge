## ðŸ›  Developer Environment

MCP Gateway is built with:

- **Python 3.10+**
- **FastAPI**
- **Pydantic Settings**
- **SQLAlchemy (async)**
- **HTMX + Alpine.js + Tailwind (for UI)**

Development tools include:

- `pytest` and `httpx` for tests
- `uvicorn` and `gunicorn` for serving the app

## ðŸ’¡ Development Philosophy

This project prioritizes:

- **Strict API consistency** with the MCP protocol
- **Composable internals** (service modules, dependency injection)
- **Production-first** design (SSL, metrics, rate limits, etc.)
- **Dev-friendly tools** (Makefile, pre-commit hooks, typed config)
