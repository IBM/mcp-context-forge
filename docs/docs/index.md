# MCP Gateway

MCP Gateway is a production-ready, standards-compliant orchestration layer for the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. It acts as a unified interface for tools, resources, prompts, virtual servers, and federated gateways ‚Äî all accessible via rich multi-transport APIs and an interactive web-based Admin UI.

---

## What it Does

- üö™ Acts as a **gateway layer** in front of MCP servers or APIs
- üîó Connects and federates multiple MCP backends (auto-discovery, failover, merging)
- üîÑ Adapts any REST API into an MCP-compliant tool or server
- üõ†Ô∏è Centralizes registration and management of tools, prompts, and resources
- üì° Exposes all endpoints over HTTP/JSON-RPC, WebSocket, Server-Sent Events (SSE), and stdio

---

## Key Features

- **Multi-Transport Support**: HTTP, WebSocket, SSE, and stdio support with auto-negotiation
- **Federation & Health Checks**: Auto-discovery, syncing, and monitoring of peer gateways
- **Admin UI**: Visual management of servers, tools, prompts, and resources (HTMX + Tailwind)
- **Tool Wrapping**: Expose REST, CLI, or local functions as JSON-RPC tools
- **Security**: JWT and Basic Auth, rate limits, SSL validation
- **Caching & Observability**: In-memory or Redis/database-backed LRU+TTL caching, structured logs

---

## Audience

MCP Gateway is designed for:

- **AI Platform Teams** that want to securely expose a variety of tools and models behind a consistent protocol
- **DevOps Engineers** looking for self-hostable control planes
- **Open-source contributors** building agents, clients, and adapters against MCP
- **Cloud Architects** deploying on Kubernetes, IBM Code Engine, AWS, or Azure
