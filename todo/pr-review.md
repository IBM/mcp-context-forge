# PR Review: Remove MCP Integration Type (#452)

## Summary
This PR removes "MCP" as an integration type option from the admin UI and API, keeping only "REST" as the supported integration type. This aligns with the requirement that MCP servers may eventually be supported under a separate "Gateways" section.

## Changes Reviewed

### 1. Schema Changes (`mcpgateway/schemas.py`)
- **Line 311**: Changed `integration_type` field from `Literal["MCP", "REST"]` to `Literal["REST"]` with default value "REST"
- **Lines 463-481**: Updated `validate_request_type` to handle REST-only validation
- **Lines 649-660**: Updated `ToolUpdate` class to only allow REST request types

**Issues Found:**
- ⚠️ **Inconsistent validation logic**: The `validate_request_type` method still has MCP validation code (lines 475-478) even though MCP is no longer a valid option
- The error messages still reference MCP which could be confusing

### 2. Admin API Changes (`mcpgateway/admin.py`)
- **Lines 1741-1750**: Added logic to default `request_type` based on `integration_type`
- **Line 1972**: Changed default integration type to "REST" in edit tool
- Updated all doctest examples to use REST instead of MCP

**Issues Found:**
- ⚠️ **Dead code**: Lines 1745-1747 check for MCP integration type but MCP is no longer a valid option
- The defaulting logic for `request_type` when `integration_type == "MCP"` will never execute

### 3. Template Changes (`mcpgateway/templates/admin.html`)
- **Line 894**: Removed `<option value="MCP">MCP</option>` from add tool modal
- **Line 2324**: Removed `<option value="MCP">MCP</option>` from edit tool modal

**Review:** ✅ Clean removal of MCP options from UI

### 4. Test Updates
- **`tests/security/test_input_validation.py`**: 
  - Commented out MCP validation tests (lines 498-503)
  - Updated default integration type assertion to "REST"
- **`tests/unit/mcpgateway/services/test_tool_service.py`**: 
  - Updated all test cases to use REST methods instead of MCP
- **`tests/unit/mcpgateway/test_admin.py`**: 
  - Updated test cases to use REST integration type
- **`docs/docs/testing/basic.md`**: 
  - Updated example to use REST instead of MCP

**Issues Found:**
- ⚠️ **Commented code**: Instead of commenting out MCP tests, they should be removed entirely

## Test Results
⚠️ **Tests cannot run due to database migration issue**:
- Error: `alembic.util.exc.CommandError: Can't locate revision identified by 'cc7b95fec5d9'`
- This appears to be an environment issue after rebasing from main, not related to the PR changes

## Recommendations

### Critical Issues to Fix:

1. **Remove dead MCP code in `mcpgateway/schemas.py`**:
   - Remove lines 475-478 that check for MCP integration type
   - Simplify the validation to only handle REST methods

2. **Remove dead MCP code in `mcpgateway/admin.py`**:
   - Remove lines 1745-1747 that handle MCP integration type
   - Simplify the defaulting logic

3. **Clean up commented tests**:
   - Remove commented MCP test code in `test_input_validation.py` instead of leaving it commented

### Minor Improvements:

1. **Update error messages**: Remove references to MCP in error messages since it's no longer supported

2. **Consider adding a database migration**: If there are existing tools with `integration_type="MCP"` in the database, a migration might be needed to update them to REST

## Overall Assessment

The PR successfully removes MCP as an integration type option from the UI and API. However, there's some dead code left behind that should be cleaned up. The changes are mostly correct but need some refinement to remove references to MCP completely.

**Recommendation**: ✅ **Approve with requested changes** - The core functionality is correct, but the dead code should be removed before merging.
