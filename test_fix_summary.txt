## Test File Issues Summary

The test file has structural problems:

1. **Duplicate import sections** - There are two sets of imports causing syntax errors
2. **Malformed code** - Line with "ap#" instead of proper comment
3. **Indentation errors** - Functions defined at wrong indentation levels
4. **Dependency override placement** - Code executing at module level incorrectly

## Quick Fix Needed:

Remove the duplicate import block starting at line ~90 that begins with:
```
ap# Standard
import os
...
```

And fix the indentation of the dependency overrides to be inside the fixture function.

The file structure should be:
1. Module-level imports (once)
2. Constants 
3. Fixtures with proper indentation
4. Test classes

Current issue is the malformed duplicate import section breaking Python syntax parsing.
